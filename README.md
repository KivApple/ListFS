ListFS
======

ListFS is simple and straightforward file system, which is designed for the study of the computer and write their own operating systems.

This file system uses wherever possible, two-way linked list.
To date, the FS does not have many features of modern systems (no access rights, file attributes, journal),
but this does not mean that it can not be added in the future.
